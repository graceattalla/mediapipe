Optimized Parameter Outputs

Parameters based on approximate optimization for each model.
Each video achieves very different percentages of frames with landmarks detected therefore it was difficult to optimize for an ideal parameter.
With the Hand Landmark model, various optimization algorithms were attemtempted however brute force was faster to test one video.
For other models, approximate optimization with different sample videos was used.

Hand Landmark:
min_hand_detection_confidence = 0.1
min_hand_presence_confidence = 0.5
min_tracking_confidence = 1

Pose:
min_pose_detection_confidence =
min_pose_presence_confidence =
min_tracking_confidence =

Holistic:
min_detection_confidence = 0.6
min_tracking_confidence = 0.9

Hand Legacy:
min_detection_confidence = 0.2
min_tracking_confidence = 0.7
0.1-0.4d and 0.1-1t are all similar with very lower outputs. Track minorly impacts percentage by 2 %
This is a an approximation.
